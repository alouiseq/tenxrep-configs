## Key Patterns

### Programs Are Table Stakes
Multiple users asking for structured workout programs, not just exercise tracking.

**Evidence:**
- Dumbbell-only user: "what is the best program for that?"
- Bodybuilder transitioning from coach: "I am now also looking for an app that will give me a program to follow"
- This is a gap TenXRep currently has vs competitors like Hevy (25+ programs)

### Core Feature Expectations
What users consistently mention wanting:
1. **Easy/quick logging** - between sets, minimal friction
2. **Reference prior weight** - know what to put on the bar
3. **Progressive overload tracking** - see improvement over time
4. **Progress visualization** - charts, visual feedback

### Fitbod Pain Points
From user currently on Fitbod looking for alternatives:
- No PC/web interface
- No data export
- **TenXRep advantage:** Already web-based, works on desktop

### What Users DON'T Mention (Unprompted)
- Muscle visualization (TenXRep's differentiator)
- 3D anatomy views
- Muscle activation levels

This doesn't mean it's not valuable - they may not know it exists. But it suggests this feature needs education/demonstration to land, not just a bullet point in a feature list.

### Thread 1: Dumbbell-Only Home Workout
**Subreddit:** r/fitness (likely)

**User Need:** Program for home workouts, dumbbells + bench only, 2-4x/week, lean body goal
**Key Quote:** "not a bodybuilder just want to get a lean body with some muscles"
**Relevance:** TenXRep has dumbbell exercises (via filter) but no programs
**Action:** Potential future feature - simple dumbbell-only program

### Thread 2: Workout Tracking Format
**Subreddit:** r/fitness (likely)
**Post:** "What sort of format/organization do you use to keep track of your workouts and numbers?"
**User Need:** Visual tracking, see improvement, know what weight to use
**Key Quote:** "I'm trying to visually track my numbers and see how I'm improving and know what to put on the bar rather than guessing"

### Thread 3: Bodybuilder Transitioning from Coach
**Subreddit:** r/bodybuilding or r/xxfitness (likely)
**Post:** "Switching directions to bodybuilding as a lifestyle without competing"
**User Need:** Workout programming and tracking after leaving coach, bikini-style split with lower body focus
**Apps Considered:** SBTD, Ladder, Liftosaur, Fitbod, Boostcamp, Alpha Progression
**My Question:** "What are key features you look for? Easy logging, programs, progress charts, muscle visuals, auto recommendations?"
**Her Response:** "Easy logging and one that can reference the prior weight used to ensure progressive overload. I am now also looking for an app that will give me a program to follow."
**Key Insight:** Muscle visualization not mentioned as a priority
**Relevance:** TenXRep has logging + prior weight reference, but NO programs
**Action:** Programs are a blocker for this user segment

### Thread 4: Fitbod Alternatives
**Subreddit:** r/fitness (likely)
**Post:** "Curious what tracking apps people use for lifting, or if you still carry around the old spiral notebook"
**User Need:** Looking for Fitbod alternatives
**Current App:** Fitbod
**Pain Points:** No PC interface, no data export
**Key Quote:** "I wish fitbod had a PC interface, a way to export data... but other than that it does a good job"
**Relevance:** TenXRep is web-based (has PC interface by default)
**Action:** Potential differentiator to highlight; consider data export feature
