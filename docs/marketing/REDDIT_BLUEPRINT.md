# Reddit Marketing Blueprint for TenXRep

A comprehensive guide for acquiring users through Reddit without getting banned or ignored.

---

## Overview

**Goal:** Find high-intent users asking about workout tracking apps and position TenXRep as a helpful solution.

**Success Rate:** 80% of companies fail at Reddit marketing (banned within first month). The 20% who succeed report it as their highest-ROI channel.

**Time Investment:** 30-60 minutes daily for first 30 days, then 15-30 minutes for maintenance.

---

## The Golden Rules

### 1. The 90/10 Rule (Reddit's Official Guideline)
- **90%** of your activity = genuine, value-adding participation
- **10%** of your activity = subtle, contextual product mentions
- If more than 10% of your comments mention TenXRep, you're doing it wrong

### 2. First-Touch Attribution
- Answer their question FIRST
- Mention TenXRep SECOND
- Drop links NEVER (unless they ask)

### 3. The 30-Day Warmup
- New accounts get auto-filtered in most subreddits
- Spend 2-4 weeks making helpful, non-promotional comments
- Build karma before any promotion
- **Minimum:** 14+ days, 30-50 comments, 200-300 karma before ANY product mention
- Accounts that skip warmup have a **90% ban rate within 30 days**

### 4. Contextual Value > Random Karma
- The 90/10 rule is outdated if you're building karma in irrelevant subreddits
- Posting memes in r/funny 9 times before dropping a link in r/fitness doesn't build credibility
- Build karma IN the communities where you'll eventually promote

## The "Low Comment" Strategy

**Why it works:** A post with 200 comments = your reply gets buried. A post with 3 comments = you're near the top.

**What to look for:**
- Posts less than 6 hours old
- Fewer than 10 comments
- Asking for recommendations or solutions
- Expressing frustration with current options

**How to find them:**
1. Search your target subreddits
2. Sort by "New" (not Hot/Top)
3. Look for posts matching the criteria above

---

## Search Queries (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Problem-Aware Users (Looking for Solutions)

```
reddit.com/r/fitness workout tracking app
reddit.com/r/fitness "looking for" app
reddit.com/r/fitness "recommend" tracking
reddit.com/r/fitness "how do you track" workouts
reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness "what app"
reddit.com/r/calisthenics tracking progress
reddit.com/r/GYM "best app" workout
reddit.com/r/workout "app for" gym
```

### Frustrated Users (Unhappy with Current Solutions)

```
reddit.com/r/fitness "hate" workout app
reddit.com/r/fitness "frustrated" tracking
reddit.com/r/fitness spreadsheet workout
reddit.com/r/GYM "pen and paper" workout
reddit.com/r/fitness "switched from" app
reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness "stopped using" app
```

### Muscle Targeting (TenXRep's Differentiator)

```
reddit.com/r/fitness "which muscles" worked
reddit.com/r/fitness muscle groups exercise
reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness visualize muscles
reddit.com/r/fitness "muscle activation"
reddit.com/r/fitness "target" muscles workout
reddit.com/r/GYM "what muscles" exercise
```

### Beginner/Lost Users

```
reddit.com/r/fitness "lost in the gym"
reddit.com/r/fitness "don't know what to do"
reddit.com/r/GYM "beginner" routine app
reddit.com/r/fitness "overwhelmed" workout
```

## Response Templates

### Template 1: Helpful First, Subtle Mention

> [Answer their specific question with 2-3 other app recommendations]
>
> For the muscle targeting part specifically — I built something for this. It shows a 3D model of which muscles each exercise hits, so you can see what you're working and what you're missing.
>
> It's in beta right now and I'm looking for a few people to help test — happy to send you access if that sounds useful.
>
> [Ask a follow-up question to keep conversation going]

### Template 2: Beta Tester Angle

> [Brief helpful answer]
>
> I actually built an app for this exact problem — I was frustrated that nothing showed me which muscles I was actually hitting. It has a 3D body model that visualizes muscle targeting.
>
> Free while I'm beta testing, no subscription. Just looking for feedback. DM me if you want to try it.

### Template 3: Replying to a Relevant Comment

> I built something similar to this — but with 3D visualization so you can actually see the muscle map on a body model. Still in beta and looking for testers if you want to compare.

### Template 4: Addressing "No Subscription" Requests

> For the muscle targeting part — I built something specifically for this. 3D model shows exactly which muscles each exercise hits.
>
> It's free right now while I'm beta testing — no subscription, no purchase. Just trying to get it right before launch. DM me if you want access.

## What TO DO

1. **Read the thread first** — see what's already been suggested
2. **Answer the actual question** — be genuinely helpful
3. **Mention other apps** — shows you're not just pushing yours
4. **Use "I built" not "we built"** — personal connection
5. **Say "DM me"** — keeps links out of comments (safer)
6. **Ask follow-up questions** — keeps conversation going
7. **Respond to replies** — engagement helps visibility
8. **Post at active times** — weekday mornings/evenings in US timezones
9. **Check subreddit rules** — some have specific self-promo days

---

## What NOT TO DO

1. **Don't drop links** in your first posts
2. **Don't post the same thing** in multiple communities
3. **Don't make your profile** look like a sales page
4. **Don't write low-effort comments** with links
5. **Don't argue** with downvoters or mods
6. **Don't use emojis** — Redditors hate them
7. **Don't use brand new accounts** — warm up first
8. **Don't say "Check out my app!"** — too salesy
9. **Don't ignore negative feedback** — respond gracefully
10. **Don't be pushy** if someone says no

---

## Handling Common Objections

### "I'm not consistent enough to beta test"

> No worries at all — honestly even occasional use helps me find bugs, so no pressure to be consistent. The offer stands if you ever want to try it.

### "I already use [Hevy/Strong/etc]"

> Totally fair — those are solid. The main difference with what I built is the 3D muscle visualization, so you can actually see which muscles you're hitting. Might be useful as a complement if you're into that, but sounds like you've got a good setup.

### "Is it free?"

> Free while I'm beta testing — no subscription, no purchase. Just looking for feedback before I figure out pricing.

### "iOS or Android?"

> It's a web app right now, so works on both — just open it in your browser. Native apps are on the roadmap.
