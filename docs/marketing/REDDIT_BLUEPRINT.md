# Reddit Marketing Blueprint for TenXRep

A comprehensive guide for acquiring users through Reddit without getting banned or ignored.

---

## Overview

**Goal:** Find high-intent users asking about workout tracking apps and position TenXRep as a helpful solution.

**Success Rate:** 80% of companies fail at Reddit marketing (banned within first month). The 20% who succeed report it as their highest-ROI channel.

**Time Investment:** 30-60 minutes daily for first 30 days, then 15-30 minutes for maintenance.

---

## The Golden Rules

### 1. The 90/10 Rule (Reddit's Official Guideline)
- **90%** of your activity = genuine, value-adding participation
- **10%** of your activity = subtle, contextual product mentions
- If more than 10% of your comments mention TenXRep, you're doing it wrong

### 2. First-Touch Attribution
- Answer their question FIRST
- Mention TenXRep SECOND
- Drop links NEVER (unless they ask)

### 3. The 30-Day Warmup
- New accounts get auto-filtered in most subreddits
- Spend 2-4 weeks making helpful, non-promotional comments
- Build karma before any promotion
- **Minimum:** 14+ days, 30-50 comments, 200-300 karma before ANY product mention
- Accounts that skip warmup have a **90% ban rate within 30 days**

### 4. Contextual Value > Random Karma
- The 90/10 rule is outdated if you're building karma in irrelevant subreddits
- Posting memes in r/funny 9 times before dropping a link in r/fitness doesn't build credibility
- Build karma IN the communities where you'll eventually promote

---

## Reddit Stats (Why This Matters)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Daily active users | 108.1M (+31% YoY) |
| Reddit in Google product review queries | 97.5% |
| Reddit CPCs vs Facebook | 50-70% cheaper |
| Reddit CPCs vs LinkedIn | 70-85% cheaper |

---

## Target Subreddits

### Primary (Your Actual Users)

| Subreddit | Size | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| r/fitness | 11M+ | Largest, most competitive |
| r/bodyweightfitness | 3M+ | Calisthenics focus - perfect for TenXRep |
| r/GYM | 2M+ | General gym-goers |
| r/weightroom | 500K+ | Serious lifters |
| r/naturalbodybuilding | 300K+ | Drug-free bodybuilders |
| r/calisthenics | 200K+ | Bodyweight training |
| r/workout | 100K+ | General, less competitive |
| r/StartingStrength | 100K+ | Beginners |
| r/homegym | 500K+ | Home workout enthusiasts |

### Secondary (Builder/Startup Story)

| Subreddit | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| r/SideProject | Sharing what you built — "gold standard for project sharing" |
| r/Entrepreneur | Business journey stories |
| r/startups | Startup advice threads |
| r/SaaS | SaaS-specific discussions |
| r/IndieHackers | Very welcoming to builders |

### Beta-Friendly Subreddits (Self-Promo Allowed)

| Subreddit | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| r/alphaandbetausers | SaaS products, mobile apps, web services in beta |
| r/TestMyApp | Mobile apps, web apps, fitness/productivity apps |
| r/IMadeThis | Showcasing personal projects |
| r/shamelessplug | Direct self-promotion allowed |

---

## Best Times to Post

### Peak Engagement Windows (US Eastern Time)

| Time | Why |
|------|-----|
| **6-9 AM EST** | Best overall — posts gain momentum before noon traffic |
| **12-2 PM EST** | Lunch break browsing |
| **7-9 PM EST** | Evening browsing (more competition) |

### Best Days
- **Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday** = highest activity
- **Monday/Friday** = slight dip
- **Weekends** = lower activity, less competition

### Why Timing Matters
- The **first hour** after posting is critical — early upvotes signal quality to the algorithm
- Morning posts outperform evening posts because they gain momentum before peak traffic
- A post that gains 100 upvotes in 10 minutes ranks higher than one that gains 100 in 10 hours

### Fitness Subreddit Timing
- r/fitness and r/GYM peak during US morning hours (6-9 AM EST)
- Evening posts face more competition but higher browsing volume

---

## The "Low Comment" Strategy

**Why it works:** A post with 200 comments = your reply gets buried. A post with 3 comments = you're near the top.

**What to look for:**
- Posts less than 6 hours old
- Fewer than 10 comments
- Asking for recommendations or solutions
- Expressing frustration with current options

**How to find them:**
1. Search your target subreddits
2. Sort by "New" (not Hot/Top)
3. Look for posts matching the criteria above

---

## Search Queries (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Problem-Aware Users (Looking for Solutions)

```
reddit.com/r/fitness workout tracking app
reddit.com/r/fitness "looking for" app
reddit.com/r/fitness "recommend" tracking
reddit.com/r/fitness "how do you track" workouts
reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness "what app"
reddit.com/r/calisthenics tracking progress
reddit.com/r/GYM "best app" workout
reddit.com/r/workout "app for" gym
```

### Frustrated Users (Unhappy with Current Solutions)

```
reddit.com/r/fitness "hate" workout app
reddit.com/r/fitness "frustrated" tracking
reddit.com/r/fitness spreadsheet workout
reddit.com/r/GYM "pen and paper" workout
reddit.com/r/fitness "switched from" app
reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness "stopped using" app
```

### Muscle Targeting (TenXRep's Differentiator)

```
reddit.com/r/fitness "which muscles" worked
reddit.com/r/fitness muscle groups exercise
reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness visualize muscles
reddit.com/r/fitness "muscle activation"
reddit.com/r/fitness "target" muscles workout
reddit.com/r/GYM "what muscles" exercise
```

### Beginner/Lost Users

```
reddit.com/r/fitness "lost in the gym"
reddit.com/r/fitness "don't know what to do"
reddit.com/r/GYM "beginner" routine app
reddit.com/r/fitness "overwhelmed" workout
```

## Response Templates

### Template 1: Helpful First, Subtle Mention

> [Answer their specific question with 2-3 other app recommendations]
>
> For the muscle targeting part specifically — I built something for this. It shows a 3D model of which muscles each exercise hits, so you can see what you're working and what you're missing.
>
> It's in beta right now and I'm looking for a few people to help test — happy to send you access if that sounds useful.
>
> [Ask a follow-up question to keep conversation going]

### Template 2: Beta Tester Angle

> [Brief helpful answer]
>
> I actually built an app for this exact problem — I was frustrated that nothing showed me which muscles I was actually hitting. It has a 3D body model that visualizes muscle targeting.
>
> Free while I'm beta testing, no subscription. Just looking for feedback. DM me if you want to try it.

### Template 3: Replying to a Relevant Comment

> I built something similar to this — but with 3D visualization so you can actually see the muscle map on a body model. Still in beta and looking for testers if you want to compare.

### Template 4: Addressing "No Subscription" Requests

> For the muscle targeting part — I built something specifically for this. 3D model shows exactly which muscles each exercise hits.
>
> It's free right now while I'm beta testing — no subscription, no purchase. Just trying to get it right before launch. DM me if you want access.

## What TO DO

1. **Read the thread first** — see what's already been suggested
2. **Answer the actual question** — be genuinely helpful
3. **Mention other apps** — shows you're not just pushing yours
4. **Use "I built" not "we built"** — personal connection
5. **Say "DM me"** — keeps links out of comments (safer)
6. **Ask follow-up questions** — keeps conversation going
7. **Respond to replies** — engagement helps visibility
8. **Post at active times** — weekday mornings/evenings in US timezones
9. **Check subreddit rules** — some have specific self-promo days

---

## What NOT TO DO

1. **Don't drop links** in your first posts
2. **Don't post the same thing** in multiple communities (triggers spam detection)
3. **Don't make your profile** look like a sales page
4. **Don't write low-effort comments** with links
5. **Don't argue** with downvoters or mods
6. **Don't use emojis** — Redditors hate them
7. **Don't use brand new accounts** — warm up first
8. **Don't say "Check out my app!"** — too salesy
9. **Don't ignore negative feedback** — respond gracefully
10. **Don't be pushy** if someone says no
11. **Don't use a VPN** when creating a new account
12. **Don't edit links into posts** after gaining traction (gets flagged)
13. **Don't use marketing adjectives** (best, leading, revolutionary, game-changing)
14. **Don't use duplicate content** — Reddit detects copy-paste across posts
15. **Don't use corporate/branded usernames** (e.g., "TenXRep_Official")

---

## The "Proof Without Pitch" Framework

When you DO post about TenXRep, use this structure:

1. **Lead with clear disclosure:** "I'm the founder of TenXRep"
2. **Share concrete data:** 3-7 specific numbers (users, feedback themes, time to build, etc.)
3. **Document methods people can replicate** without your product
4. **Include tradeoffs and what didn't work** — honesty builds trust
5. **No link in the post** — let people ask for it

**Example:**
> I'm the founder of TenXRep. After 3 months of beta testing with 47 users, here's what I learned about workout tracking:
>
> - 80% of users said they didn't know which muscles they were neglecting
> - The most requested feature was seeing muscle groups visually (which led me to build 3D visualization)
> - What didn't work: trying to compete with Hevy/Strong on tracking features — they're too established
>
> If anyone's interested in the muscle visualization approach, happy to share more.

## The CTA Ladder (Trust-Building Progression)

Progress through these levels over weeks/months:

| Level | Action | When to Use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Zero-link posts (pure help, no asks) | First 2 weeks |
| 2 | Comment-first seeding (10-20 threads/week, no product mention) | Weeks 2-4 |
| 3 | Soft mentions without links | After 200+ karma |
| 4 | Opt-in resources via DM only ("DM me if interested") | After positive engagement |
| 5 | Links only when explicitly requested | When someone asks |
| 6 | Hard CTAs | Rare — only in promo-allowed spaces |

---

## Weekly Engagement Cadence

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Mon/Wed/Fri | 5-7 high-effort comments (no promo) |
| Tuesday | One "proof post" in builder subreddit (no link) |
| Thursday | Feedback-request post or AMA |
| Daily | 10-minute follow-up on previous comments |

**Comment-to-Post Ratio:** Comments generate 3-5x more qualified engagement than posts for most SaaS companies.

---

## Karma Building (The Right Way)

### Do:
- Comment early on rising posts (first 20 comments = more visibility)
- Be helpful in educational/professional subreddits (earn karma 30% faster)
- Short, easy-to-understand, emotional/funny comments perform best
- Post daily on niche hobby subs and act like a real user

### Don't:
- Post more than 4 times per hour or 12-16 times daily
- Repost popular content or use clickbait
- Downvotes hurt more than upvotes help (1 downvote = -2 to -3 karma, 1 upvote = +1)

### Quick Karma Subreddits (to build baseline):
- r/AskReddit — answer questions thoughtfully
- r/pics — comment on rising posts
- r/todayilearned — add context to posts
- Then transition to r/fitness, r/bodyweightfitness for relevant karma

---

## Shadowban Prevention & Detection

### What is a Shadowban?
Your posts/comments are visible to YOU but hidden from everyone else. You won't know unless you check.

### How to Check:
1. **Incognito test:** Open your profile in incognito/private mode. If "page not found" = shadowbanned
2. **r/ShadowBan:** Post there — a bot will tell you your status
3. **Online tools:** cable.ayra.ch/reddit/ or shadowbanchecker.net

### Prevention:
- Don't use VPN when creating accounts
- Don't interact with your posts from alternate accounts
- Don't spam multiple subreddits at once with the same link
- Don't post duplicate content

### If Shadowbanned:
- Don't create a new account to evade (leads to permanent ban)
- File an appeal at reddit.com/appeals
- Be polite and honest

---

## Handling Common Objections

### "I'm not consistent enough to beta test"

> No worries at all — honestly even occasional use helps me find bugs, so no pressure to be consistent. The offer stands if you ever want to try it.

### "I already use [Hevy/Strong/etc]"

> Totally fair — those are solid. The main difference with what I built is the 3D muscle visualization, so you can actually see which muscles you're hitting. Might be useful as a complement if you're into that, but sounds like you've got a good setup.

### "Is it free?"

> Free while I'm beta testing — no subscription, no purchase. Just looking for feedback before I figure out pricing.

### "iOS or Android?"

> It's a web app right now, so works on both — just open it in your browser. Native apps are on the roadmap.

## Gotchas & Lessons Learned

### From Research:

**Account & Posting:**
- The failure rate is 80% — patience and authenticity are everything
- Accounts that skip warmup have a 90% ban rate within 30 days
- One marketer: "My old strategy was: create account, join relevant subreddits, start commenting with links. Within 3 days, banned. Every single time."
- Reddit detects duplicate content and flags it — never copy-paste the same comment

**Content & Engagement:**
- Posts that include personal stories have the best engagement
- Specificity wins: "I built a tool that does X because I was tired of Y" > "I built a workout app"
- Comments generate 3-5x more qualified engagement than posts
- The first hour after posting is everything — early upvotes are crucial
- A post from 6 hours ago with 3 comments might explode to 200 by tomorrow

**What Gets Flagged:**
- The "stealth promotion pattern": Generic value story → humble disclaimer → product mention → link drop
- Using "humblebrag" tone or marketing speak
- Editing links into posts after gaining traction
- Corporate/branded usernames

**Timing:**
- Morning posts consistently outperform evening posts
- Engagement starts to decline after 12-3 PM
- Posts published late in the day often miss the noon traffic cycle and get buried
