# Indie Hackers Marketing Blueprint for TenXRep

A comprehensive guide for building presence and acquiring users through Indie Hackers using the "Build in Public" strategy.

---

## Overview

**Goal:** Build credibility and acquire early users by documenting your journey building TenXRep on the Indie Hackers community.

**Why Indie Hackers Works:**
- 23% conversion rate per engaged post (vs Product Hunt's 3%)
- Community expects and welcomes product sharing
- Founders actively looking for tools to use
- Long-term relationship building, not one-off launches
- Lower time investment than Twitter (no daily engagement required)

**Time Investment:** 15-30 minutes daily for engagement + 1-2 hours weekly for milestone posts.

**Expected Results:**
- 1,200+ targeted visitors possible in 6 weeks with consistent engagement
- Higher-quality leads (founders = potential power users + word-of-mouth)
- Credibility that compounds over time

## Content Strategy

### The Content Hierarchy (What Performs Best)

| Rank | Content Type | Engagement Level | Example |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| 1 | Success stories with numbers | Highest | "How I got 100 beta users in 2 weeks" |
| 2 | Guides and tutorials | High | "The tech stack I chose for my fitness app (and why)" |
| 3 | Failure stories with lessons | High | "Why my first landing page converted at 0.5%" |
| 4 | Journey updates with metrics | Medium-High | "Week 4: 47 signups, 3 feature requests shipped" |
| 5 | Questions and discussions | Medium | "How do you validate a fitness app idea?" |
| 6 | Neutral build stories | Medium | "How I built 3D muscle visualization in React" |
| 7 | Product announcements | Lowest | "Check out my new app!" ❌ |

### The 90/10 Rule

Just like Reddit, follow the 90/10 ratio:
- **90%:** Pure value (insights, lessons, answering questions, helping others)
- **10%:** Subtle product mentions when contextually relevant

### What to Post

**Early Stage (Pre-Revenue):**
```
I'm building a workout app that shows which muscles you're targeting in 3D.

Here's why: I noticed most gym-goers (myself included) have no idea if they're
hitting all muscle groups evenly. Spreadsheets feel like work, and existing
apps just show numbers.

What I'm trying to solve:
- Visual feedback on muscle coverage
- Identify neglected muscle groups
- Make tracking feel less like data entry

Anyone else frustrated with current workout apps? What's missing for you?
```

**Technical Deep-Dive:**
```
## How I Built Real-Time 3D Muscle Visualization for My Workout App

The hardest part of building TenXRep wasn't the workout tracking — it was
making a 3D muscle model that updates as you log exercises.

Here's what I learned:

### Challenge 1: Performance
Three.js renders were killing mobile performance...

### Challenge 2: Muscle Mapping
Mapping 650+ exercises to specific muscle groups...

### What I'd Do Differently
...

Happy to answer questions about the tech stack or approach!
```

**Milestone Update:**
```
## Week 6 Update: 89 Beta Signups, First Real Feedback

Quick update on TenXRep progress:

**Numbers:**
- 89 waitlist signups (up from 47 last week)
- 12 beta testers actively using the app
- 3 feature requests implemented

**What's Working:**
- The 3D muscle map is resonating — it's the #1 thing people mention
- Reddit posts in r/fitness driving most signups

**What's Not Working:**
- Landing page conversion is only 2.1% — need to improve copy
- Onboarding flow is confusing users

**This Week's Focus:**
- Redesign onboarding
- A/B test landing page headline

What's your experience with onboarding for fitness apps?
```

**Question Post:**
```
## For Those Who've Built Fitness/Health Apps: What Was Your Biggest Surprise?

Building TenXRep (workout tracker with 3D visualization) and curious what
surprised other founders in this space.

For me, it's been how much users care about *seeing* their progress visually
vs just having numbers in a spreadsheet.

What unexpected insights did you discover building health/fitness products?
```

## Posting Best Practices

### Timing

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Best day | Thursday |
| Best time | Morning US/EU time zones |
| Frequency | 1-2 quality posts per week |
| Milestones | Whenever you hit one (don't force it) |

### Formatting

Indie Hackers uses Markdown:

```markdown
## Heading (use for sections)
### Subheading
**Bold text**
*Italic text*

- Bullet point
- Another point

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

> Quote or callout

`code snippet`
```

### Title Formulas That Work

**Questions:**
- "How do you validate [topic]?"
- "What's your approach to [challenge]?"
- "Anyone else struggling with [problem]?"

**Numbers:**
- "How I got [X] users in [Y] time"
- "Week [N]: [Metric] and what I learned"
- "$[Amount] MRR — here's the breakdown"

**Lessons:**
- "What I learned building [thing]"
- "[N] mistakes I made with [topic]"
- "The [adjective] truth about [topic]"

### What NOT to Do

1. ❌ **Pure announcements:** "Check out my new app!" (lowest engagement)
2. ❌ **Vague updates:** "Making progress!" (no specifics = no engagement)
3. ❌ **Wall of text:** Keep it scannable with headers and bullets
4. ❌ **No value:** Always include a lesson, insight, or question
5. ❌ **Ignoring comments:** Reply to everyone — builds reputation
6. ❌ **Spammy frequency:** Quality over quantity

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes
1. **Only posting announcements** — Lowest engagement type
2. **No specific numbers** — Vague updates get ignored
3. **Too long without structure** — Use headers and bullets
4. **No lesson or value** — Always include a takeaway
5. **Posting too frequently** — Quality over quantity

### Engagement Mistakes
1. **Not replying to comments** — Kills discussion and reputation
2. **Only promoting, never helping** — Community notices
3. **Generic comments** — "Great post!" adds nothing
4. **Ignoring others' posts** — Engagement is reciprocal

### Strategy Mistakes
1. **Expecting instant results** — This takes months
2. **Treating it as a launch platform** — It's a community, not Product Hunt
3. **Inconsistent posting** — Regular rhythm builds following
4. **Not tracking results** — Use UTMs to measure impact

- Use Twitter for daily engagement, IH for weekly deep-dives
- Link Twitter in IH posts for followers who want more frequent updates

### IH + Reddit Strategy
- IH is more promotion-friendly than Reddit
- Use Reddit insights as content for IH posts
- "I learned this talking to r/fitness users..."

### IH + Product Hunt Strategy
- Build IH audience before PH launch
- IH followers can support your PH launch
- Share PH results on IH afterward
