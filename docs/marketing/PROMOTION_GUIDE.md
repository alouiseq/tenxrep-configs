# TenXRep Promotion Guide

A practical guide based on real Reddit engagement and lessons learned. Quick reference for daily promotion work.

---

## Current Status

- **Account stage:** Fresh / karma building
- **Karma target:** 200-300 before any app mentions
- **Warmup period:** 30 days minimum
- **TenXRep gap:** No workout programs (users keep asking for this)

---

## The Mindset

You're not promoting an app. You're a person who cares about fitness, helping other people who care about fitness. The app is a natural extension of that - not the point.

**The question isn't:** "How do I promote my app?"
**The question is:** "Where do people with this problem gather, and how can I be useful to them?"

---

## Do's

### Engagement
- **Do** respond to existing threads rather than creating new posts
- **Do** ask genuine follow-up questions ("What made you stick with that app?")
- **Do** share your own experience as a lifter, not as an app builder
- **Do** recommend competitors (Hevy, Strong) when they fit - builds trust
- **Do** save threads with engaged users to revisit later

### Content
- **Do** answer their question FIRST, completely
- **Do** use specific language, not generic ("I use X because..." not "workout apps should...")
- **Do** share opinions on apps you've actually used
- **Do** mention web-based apps solve the "no PC interface" problem (TenXRep advantage)

### Research
- **Do** note what features users mention (logging, progressive overload, programs)
- **Do** note what users DON'T mention (muscle visualization - needs education)
- **Do** track competitor pain points (Fitbod: no web, no export)
- **Do** save posts for when you have the features they want

## Don'ts

### Never (Account Risk)
- **Don't** mention your app on a fresh account - 90% ban rate
- **Don't** post "I built this" style content until karma is established
- **Don't** drop links ever (even when you have karma)
- **Don't** create new posts asking "what do you look for in an app" - reads as market research

### Avoid (Bad Impressions)
- **Don't** pitch an app that doesn't solve their stated problem
- **Don't** say "my app doesn't have X yet" - sets expectations you may not meet
- **Don't** be the person who makes every thread about your product
- **Don't** engage just to pitch - people can tell

### Messaging
- **Don't** use builder language ("features," "users," "market")
- **Don't** ask generic questions ("what features matter to you?")
- **Don't** sound like you're doing market research (even if you are)

## Response Templates

### When someone asks about tracking apps
```
I use an app - quick logging between sets and seeing last session's
numbers is what I actually use daily. The charts are nice but honestly
I just want to know what to put on the bar.
```

### When someone asks what you look for
```
Easy logging (has to be fast between sets), seeing my last weight so
I'm not guessing, and some kind of progress view. Everything else is
nice-to-have.
```

### When asking follow-up questions
```
Curious - what made you stick with it over other options?
```

```
What's not working about your current setup?
```

```
Do you actually use [feature] or is it more of a nice-to-have?
```

### When recommending alternatives (builds trust)
```
Hevy's solid for that - free tier is generous and it has a web version
if you want to plan from your computer.
```

## When You CAN Mention TenXRep

Only when ALL of these are true:

1. ✅ Account has 200-300+ karma
2. ✅ 30+ days of genuine engagement history
3. ✅ The thread is directly relevant
4. ✅ TenXRep actually solves their stated problem
5. ✅ You've answered their question first
6. ✅ No link - just mention by name if natural

**Format when ready:**
```
I've been using TenXRep for [specific use case] - [specific thing you
like about it]. [Answer rest of their question or add value].
```

Never lead with the app. Never make it the point.

## TenXRep's Real Differentiators

Use these when positioning (after warmup period):

| Differentiator | How to mention naturally |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| 3D muscle visualization | "I like seeing which muscles I'm actually hitting - helps me spot imbalances" |
| Web-based | "I use a web app so I can plan from my laptop too" |
| Precise muscle targeting | "Shows specific muscles, not just 'chest' but like upper vs lower" |
| Hybrid weights + calisthenics | "Works for both my lifting days and bodyweight stuff" |

**Note:** Users don't ask for muscle visualization unprompted. It needs demonstration, not just description. Consider creating a short video/GIF showing it in action.

---

## Current Gaps (Don't Promise These)

- ❌ Workout programs (most requested - blocks many users)
- ❌ Data export
- ❌ Mobile app (web-only currently)

Don't pitch TenXRep to users who specifically want these until you have them.

---

## Threads to Revisit

When you build programs or other features, come back to these users:

1. **Dumbbell-only user** - wants home program, 2-4x/week
2. **Bodybuilder leaving coach** - wants bikini split program, lower body focus
3. **Fitbod user** - wants PC interface, data export (you have PC interface already)

A genuine "hey, I remember you were looking for X - I actually found/built something since we talked" is memorable and not spammy.

---

## Daily Routine

**Time:** 15-30 minutes

1. Check r/fitness, r/gym, r/bodyweightfitness for new tracking/app threads
2. Engage genuinely on 2-3 threads (answer questions, ask follow-ups)
3. Note any insights in USER_FEEDBACK.md
4. Don't force it - skip days when there's nothing relevant

**Weekly:** Review saved threads, update feedback doc, check karma progress.

---

## The Long Game

This isn't a growth hack. It's building a reputation in a community over months.

The goal after 30-60 days:
- People recognize your username
- You have a history of helpful comments
- When you eventually mention your app, it's "oh that person who's always helpful made something" not "another person shilling their app"

Most people can't do this. They spam, get banned, and wonder why Reddit doesn't work. The ones who succeed are patient.
